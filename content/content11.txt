The Equifax Default Problem 
If you've checked your Equifax credit file and found defaults, you already know the damage they're causing:
�� Home loan applications: "Sorry, we can see defaults on your Equifax file" �� Car finance: "Equifax shows payment defaults - application declined" �� Credit cards: "Your Equifax credit history doesn't meet our criteria" �� Personal loans: "Multiple defaults showing on Equifax - too risky" 
�� Business finance: "Equifax personal defaults affect business applications" Here's the brutal truth: One default on Equifax can destroy your financial life for 5 years. 
Understanding Your Equifax Default 
�� What Equifax Defaults Look Like 
When you access your Equifax credit file, defaults appear as: 
Default Listing Example: 
Creditor: Telstra Corporation Ltd 
Amount: $847 
Date Listed: 15/03/2019 
Status: Unpaid Default 
Comment: "Payment default - account closed" 
This single entry can: ❌ Drop your credit score by 200+ points 
❌ Trigger automatic loan rejections 
❌ Force you into high-interest "bad credit" products 
❌ Block business and investment opportunities 
❌ Stay visible for 5 years from listing date 
�� Why Equifax Defaults Hit Harder 
Equifax is Australia's largest credit bureau: ✓ Used by all major banks for loan decisions ✓ Checked by most finance companies for applications 
✓ Referenced by credit card providers for approvals 
✓ Reviewed by business lenders for commercial finance 
✓ Monitored by mortgage brokers for pre-approvals 
If it's on Equifax, every lender will see it.
