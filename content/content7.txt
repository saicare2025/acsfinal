Credit Repair After Debt Agreement (Part 9) | Your Fresh Start Begins Now 
Congratulations. You've completed your Part 9 debt agreement and made it through one of life's toughest financial challenges. Now it's time to rebuild and reclaim your financial future. 
You've Been Through Hell – We Get It
Taking on a Part 9 debt agreement wasn't easy. You faced: 
�� The shame of financial failure 
�� The stress of creditor pressure 
�� The isolation when friends didn't understand 
�� The sacrifice of years of restricted living 
�� The lockout from normal finance options 
But you stuck with it. You completed your agreement. You proved your character. Now it's time for the reward – getting your financial life back. 
What Your Credit File Looks Like Right Now 
After completing a Part 9 debt agreement, your credit file is probably a mess: 
❌ Part 9 Debt Agreement Listing (visible for 5 years from completion) 
❌ Multiple Defaults (from before the agreement) 
❌ Late Payment Listings (historical payment problems) 
❌ Credit Enquiries (from desperate finance attempts) 
❌ Possible Court Judgments (if things went really bad) 
This is why you're still getting rejected for everything – even though you've completed your agreement. 
The Cruel Reality 
Completing your Part 9 doesn't automatically fix your credit file. 
Most Australians think finishing their debt agreement means automatic fresh start. That's not how it works. 
The Part 9 listing stays for 5 years from completion 
Defaults from before the agreement remain for 5 years from listing date 
Late payments, enquiries, and judgments all stick around 
Your credit score stays terrible until you actively fix it 
You've done the hard work. Now you need professional help to get the rewards.

Frequently Asked Questions: Part 9 Recovery 
Q: How long after completing my Part 9 can I start credit repair? 
A: Immediately. The sooner you start, the faster your recovery. Don't wait – start building your fresh start right away. 
Q: Will lenders ever trust me again after a debt agreement? 
A: Yes. Many lenders understand that debt agreements show responsibility – you paid what you could instead of just walking away. Time and positive actions rebuild trust. 
Q: Can you remove the Part 9 listing itself? 
A: Generally no – completed debt agreements stay for 5 years. But we can clean up everything around it and help you build positive credit to outweigh it. 
Q: I'm scared to apply for any credit after my agreement. Is this normal? 
A: Absolutely normal. Many clients feel this way. We'll guide you through safe, strategic applications that build confidence alongside credit. 
Q: What if I have defaults from after my debt agreement? 
A: Post-agreement defaults are often easier to remove because they show isolated incidents, not systemic problems. We have high success rates with these. 
Q: How long until I can get a home loan after Part 9? 
A: Typically 12-24 months with the right strategy. Some specialist lenders will consider applications sooner with strong rebuild evidence.
