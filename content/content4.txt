Opening Section 
Right, let's get one thing straight – a court judgment on your credit file is absolutely devastating. 
We're not talking about a little late payment mark here. Court judgments are the nuclear option of credit destruction. They basically tell every lender "this person had to be taken to court to get their money back." 
But here's what gets us really fired up: heaps of court judgments on credit files shouldn't actually be there. 
Maybe you never got proper notice of the court hearing. Maybe the debt was already paid but the judgment never got removed. Maybe the judgment was for the wrong amount, or against the wrong person entirely. Or maybe it was a default judgment that can be set aside because you had a genuine defence. 
Look, we get it – most people think once there's a court judgment, that's it, game over. But that's not always true. 
Australian Credit Solutions specialises in court judgment removal across Australia. We're not some dodgy mob promising miracles we can't deliver. We're award-winning specialists with a 98% success rate when we take cases, and we've won industry recognition three years running. 
The difference? We only take court judgment cases where we genuinely reckon there are grounds for removal or setting aside. If your judgment is rock-solid and properly obtained, we'll tell you straight up.
But if there are procedural problems, errors, or legal grounds to challenge it? We know exactly how to get court judgments removed from credit reports. 
How Court Judgments Are Absolutely Annihilating Your Credit Let's talk about the real damage a court judgment is doing to your financial life: 
Your Credit Score Gets Completely Destroyed A single court judgment can drop your credit score by 150-300 points. We've seen people go from excellent credit to barely qualifying for a basic credit card overnight. 
Every Lender Sees You as Toxic Court judgments are visible to every lender, landlord, and employer who checks your credit. They don't just see the amount – they see that you had to be taken to court to pay a debt. 
Automatic Rejections Become the Norm Most lenders have policies that automatically reject any application with a court judgment on file. Doesn't matter if you're a millionaire – the computer says no. 
Interest Rates Become Obscene (If You Get Approved at All) The few lenders who will touch you with a court judgment will charge premium rates. We're talking 15-25% interest rates even for secured loans. 
It Follows You for 5 Years Court judgments stay on your credit file for 5 years from the date they're entered. That's potentially 5 years of being locked out of decent finance options. 
Employment and Rental Applications Get Knocked Back Many employers and landlords check for court judgments. Having one can cost you job opportunities and rental applications, especially in competitive markets. 
Business Finance Becomes Impossible Personal court judgments affect business lending. If you're a business owner or tradie, a judgment on your personal file can kill your business finance options. 
What Court Judgments We Can Actually Remove or Set Aside 
Important Legal Note: We can't remove valid court judgments that were properly obtained through correct legal procedures. But loads of judgments on credit files have problems that create grounds for removal or setting aside. 
Default Judgments That Can Be Set Aside These are judgments made when you didn't appear in court, often because: 
You never received proper notice of the court hearing
Court papers were sent to old addresses after you'd moved 
You were overseas or in hospital when the hearing occurred 
You had a genuine defence but couldn't present it 
Procedurally Defective Judgments Court judgments that didn't follow proper legal procedures: 
Incorrect court jurisdiction for the case 
Insufficient notice periods before court hearings 
Failure to serve court documents properly 
Missing mandatory steps in debt recovery process 
Incorrect Judgment Information Judgments with factual errors that make them invalid: 
Wrong person named in the judgment 
Incorrect judgment amounts recorded 
Already paid debts that weren't updated 
Judgments for debts that were disputed or invalid 
Satisfied Judgments Not Updated Judgments that should show as "satisfied" but don't: 
Debts paid in full but judgment not marked satisfied 
Settlement agreements not reflected in court records 
Payment arrangements completed but not updated 
Partial payments not properly recorded 
Statute of Limitations Issues Old debts where the time limit for court action had expired: 
Debts older than 6 years (in most states) pursued illegally 
Acknowledgment of debt issues affecting limitation periods 
Proper limitation defences that weren't raised 
Judgment Based on Incorrect or Disputed Debts Court judgments for debts that were never actually owed: 
Identity theft cases where you weren't responsible 
Debts already paid to original creditors 
Disputed amounts that were pursued without resolution 
Incorrect charges or fees added to original debts
Our Proven Court Judgment Removal Process

Medical records or other evidence explaining non-appearance 
Step 4: Court Application or Credit Bureau Challenge Depending on the grounds, we either:

Success Stories: Real Aussies Who Beat Court Judgments 
Steve from Wollongong – Tradie Who Never Got Notice "Had a court judgment for $8,500 from a supplier dispute. Problem was, I'd moved house 3 months before the court date and never got the court papers. Found out about the judgment when I got knocked back for equipment finance. Spent months trying to sort it myself through the courts – got nowhere fast. ACS proved I was never properly served with the court documents and got the whole judgment set aside. Took 8 weeks but now I've got the equipment finance I needed. Saved my business." 
Maria from Adelaide – Mum Hit by Identity Theft "Someone stole my identity and racked up $12,000 in credit card debt, then the bank got a court judgment when I wouldn't pay for debts I didn't create. Even with a police report, the judgment stayed on my file for 2 years, destroying my credit. ACS worked with their solicitor to get the judgment set aside based on the identity theft evidence. Credit file cleaned up, score went from 350 to 710. Finally got approved for the home loan we'd been trying to get for years." 
Rob from Darwin – Small Business Owner "Court judgment for $15,000 from a business that went bust during COVID. I'd already paid the debt directly to the company before they went into liquidation, but the liquidator still pursued the court judgment. Had all the payment receipts but couldn't get anyone to listen. ACS got the judgment marked as satisfied and removed from my credit file. Business credit applications started getting approved again. Can't believe the difference it made." 
Lisa from Hobart – Teacher Who Moved Interstate "Got a court judgment for a phone bill from when I moved from Melbourne to Hobart. Telco sent all the court papers to my old Melbourne address even though I'd updated my details with them. First I knew about it was when I couldn't get a car loan 6 months later. ACS proved the service was defective because they used the old address despite having my new one. Got the judgment set aside and my credit back to normal."

Understanding Court Judgments: Your Legal Rights 
How Court Judgments Actually Work 
Most Aussies don't understand the court judgment process until it's too late: 
Default Judgments Are Common About 80% of court judgments are "default judgments" – meaning the defendant didn't appear in court. Many of these happen because people don't receive proper notice. 
Service of Process Requirements Creditors must properly serve court documents according to strict legal procedures. If service is defective, the judgment can be set aside.
Time Limits for Challenges There are usually time limits for setting aside judgments, but exceptions exist for: 
Lack of proper service 
Fraud or misrepresentation 
New evidence becoming available 
Your Rights After a Judgment Even with a valid judgment, you have rights: 
Right to payment arrangements 
Right to have satisfied judgments marked as paid 
Right to challenge incorrect judgment amounts 
Why Professional Help Is Essential Court procedures are complex and technical. Self-represented parties often make procedural errors that doom their applications. You need expertise to navigate the system effectively. 
Common Questions About Court Judgment Removal 
Can all court judgments be removed from credit files? No, only judgments with legal grounds for challenge can be removed or set aside. Valid judgments obtained through proper procedures will stay on your file for 5 years. But heaps of judgments have problems that create removal opportunities. 
What's the difference between removing and setting aside a judgment? Setting aside means getting the court to cancel the original judgment (usually requiring a new court hearing). Removal means getting it off your credit file without court involvement (usually for already satisfied judgments or reporting errors). 
How much does it cost to set aside a court judgment? Court filing fees vary by state but are usually $100-300. Solicitor fees for complex applications can be $2,000-5,000+. Our service includes solicitor assistance where needed at no extra cost. 
Will setting aside a judgment remove it from my credit file? Yes, if a judgment is successfully set aside, it must be removed from your credit file. We ensure all credit bureaus update their records. 
Can I set aside a judgment if I actually owed the money? Possibly, if there were procedural problems with how the judgment was obtained. Even valid debts can result in invalid judgments if proper procedures weren't followed. 
What if I've already paid the debt but the judgment is still showing? Satisfied judgments should be marked as "satisfied" on your credit file. If this hasn't happened, we can get the court records and credit
file updated. 
How long does court judgment removal take? Depends on the approach. Credit bureau challenges can take 4-8 weeks. Court applications to set aside judgments can take 8-16 weeks depending on court backlogs. 
What evidence do I need to challenge a court judgment? Evidence depends on the grounds for challenge, but commonly includes proof of address changes, payment records, correspondence with creditors, or documentation of procedural failures. 
The Massive Cost of Keeping a Court Judgment 
Financial Impact Is Devastating 
Let's talk real numbers about what that court judgment is actually costing you: Home Loan Access Disappears 
No judgment: Access to best rates (around 6.2% variable) 
With judgment: Usually declined completely, or forced into non-bank lending at 9-15% If you can even get approved, you're looking at $200,000+ extra in interest over 30 years. Car Finance Becomes Predatory 
Clean credit: Bank rates from 5.9% 
With judgment: Dealer finance from 18-25% if you're lucky 
$40,000 car loan becomes an $80,000+ disaster with judgment rates. 
Credit Cards Are Almost Impossible 
No judgment: Platinum rewards cards, $25,000+ limits 
With judgment: Maybe a secured card with $1,000 limit at 25% interest 
Business Finance Dies Completely Personal judgments kill business lending opportunities: 
Equipment finance rejections 
Business loan declinations 
Commercial mortgage impossibility 
Trade credit restrictions
Employment Opportunities Vanish Background checks showing court judgments can cost you jobs in: 
Banking and finance roles 
Accounting and bookkeeping 
Senior management positions 
Government positions 
Roles requiring security clearances 
Rental Applications Get Rejected Landlords see court judgments as red flags. In competitive markets like Sydney and Melbourne, judgments often mean automatic rental rejection. 
The 5-Year Penalty Every day that judgment stays on your file is another day of restricted opportunities and financial penalties. It compounds over time.
