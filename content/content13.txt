How Many Points Does a Hard Inquiry Affect Your Credit Score? Last updated: September 2025 | Australian Credit Solutions
If you've recently applied for a credit card, personal loan, or home loan, you might be wondering: "How many points will this hard inquiry drop my credit score?" It's a question that keeps many Australians awake at night, especially when they're already struggling with credit issues. 
The short answer? A single hard inquiry typically drops your credit score by 2-5 points. But here's what most people don't understand - it's not just about the points. It's about the bigger picture of your credit health and how multiple inquiries can create a snowball effect that devastates your borrowing power. 
What Exactly Is a Hard Inquiry? 
A hard inquiry (also called a hard credit check) happens when a lender requests your full credit report to make a lending decision. Unlike soft inquiries that don't affect your score, hard inquiries leave a mark on your credit file for 2 years. 
Here's when hard inquiries typically occur in Australia: 
Home loan applications 
Car loan applications 
Credit card applications 
Personal loan applications 
Business loan applications 
Phone plan applications (some providers) 
Rental applications (some agents) 
The Real Impact: Beyond Just "2-5 Points" 
While financial websites love to quote the "2-5 points" figure, the reality for struggling Australians is far more complex: 
For People with Good Credit (750+ score): 
Impact: Minimal - usually 2-3 points 
Recovery time: 3-6 months 
Lending impact: Virtually none 
For People with Fair Credit (650-749 score): 
Impact: Moderate - usually 3-5 points 
Recovery time: 6-12 months 
Lending impact: Might push you into a higher risk category
For People with Poor Credit (Below 650): 
Impact: Severe - can be 5+ points 
Recovery time: 12+ months 
Lending impact: Could be the difference between approval and rejection 
Here's the brutal truth: If your credit score is already damaged by defaults, late payments, or previous rejections, even a small drop from hard inquiries can push you into the "automatic rejection" category for most lenders. 
The Multiple Inquiry Trap 
Sarah from Brisbane learned this the hard way. After being rejected for a car loan, she applied to six different lenders in two weeks. Each rejection meant another hard inquiry, and each inquiry dropped her score further. 
The result? 
6 hard inquiries = 25+ point drop 
Credit score fell from 640 to 615 
Went from "maybe approved" to "automatic rejection" 
Spent the next 18 months rebuilding her credit 
This is why we always tell clients: "Stop applying for credit when you're getting rejected. Fix the underlying issues first." 
How Long Do Hard Inquiries Stay on Your Credit File? 
In Australia, hard inquiries remain visible on your credit report for 2 full years. However, their impact on your credit score diminishes over time: 
0-12 months: Full impact on your score 
12-24 months: Reduced impact (about half) 
24+ months: Inquiry falls off your report completely 
But here's what most people don't realise - lenders can see these inquiries for the full 2 years, even when they're not affecting your score anymore. A pattern of multiple rejections tells lenders you're "desperate for credit" - a massive red flag. 
The Inquiry Pattern That Destroys Your Credit 
We see this pattern constantly at Australian Credit Solutions:
1. Financial stress hits (job loss, divorce, medical bills) 
2. Credit applications increase (trying to manage cash flow) 
3. Rejections start coming (due to existing credit issues) 
4. More applications follow ("Maybe the next lender will say yes") 
5. Credit score plummets (multiple inquiries + existing problems) 
6. All future applications rejected (now in the "high risk" category) 
Sound familiar? You're not alone. This cycle traps thousands of Australians every year. When Hard Inquiries Don't Count (Much) 
There are some exceptions where multiple inquiries are treated more leniently: 
Rate Shopping Window 
If you're shopping for the same type of loan within a short period, multiple inquiries may be treated as a single inquiry. This typically applies to: 
Home loans: 14-45 day window 
Car loans: 14-45 day window 
Personal loans: Usually no protection 
Important: This protection only applies if you have good credit to begin with. If you already have defaults or late payments, lenders won't care about the "rate shopping" excuse. 
How to Minimize Hard Inquiry Damage 
Before You Apply: 
1. Check your credit score first (free services like Equifax) 
2. Use pre-qualification tools (soft inquiries only) 
3. Apply only when confident of approval 
4. Space applications at least 6 months apart 
If You're Getting Rejected: 
1. STOP applying immediately 
2. Find out why you're being rejected 
3. Fix the underlying issues first 
4. Wait 6-12 months before trying again
When Multiple Inquiries Signal Bigger Problems 
At Australian Credit Solutions, we often see clients with 10, 15, even 20+ inquiries in their credit file. While each inquiry only drops their score a few points, the real damage is what those inquiries represent: 
Defaults (the real score killers) 
Late payments (systematic payment issues) 
High credit utilisation (financial stress) 
Previous bankruptcies (major credit events) 
The hard truth: If you're worried about inquiry points, you probably have bigger credit problems that need professional attention. 
Real Client Story: The Inquiry Avalanche 
Mark, a tradesman from Melbourne, came to us with this exact problem: 
The Situation: 
Credit score: 580 (poor) 
2 defaults totaling $3,400 
12 hard inquiries in 18 months 
Rejected for every loan application 
What He Thought: "If I just wait for these inquiries to fall off, I'll get approved." 
The Reality: The inquiries weren't his main problem - the defaults were. Even with zero inquiries, no mainstream lender would approve him with active defaults. 
Our Solution: 
1. Removed both defaults (legitimate disputes) 
2. Negotiated payment plans for outstanding debts 
3. Coached him to stop applying for 6 months 
4. Rebuilt his credit systematically 
The Result: 
Credit score jumped from 580 to 720 
Approved for car finance at 8.9% (was being quoted 18%+) 
Saved $7,200 in interest over the loan term
Got his financial confidence back 
The lesson: Fix the big problems first. The inquiry damage will heal naturally. The Credit Inquiry Myths That Cost You Money 
Myth 1: "Checking my own credit hurts my score" 
Truth: Checking your own credit is a soft inquiry - it never affects your score. 
Myth 2: "I need to wait 2 years for inquiries to disappear" Truth: You need to wait 2 years for inquiries to disappear, but you can fix bigger issues now. 
Myth 3: "Multiple inquiries always hurt more than single inquiries" Truth: Sometimes multiple inquiries are treated as one (rate shopping window). 
Myth 4: "Inquiries are my biggest credit problem" 
Truth: Usually they're a symptom, not the cause. 
What Hurts Your Credit Score MORE Than Inquiries If you're stressing about inquiry points, you're probably missing the real score killers: 
Defaults: -50 to -150 points each 
Stay on your file for 5 years 
Visible to every lender 
Almost guarantee rejections 
Late Payments: -10 to -50 points each 
Pattern of late payments destroys creditworthiness 
Shows lenders you can't manage money 
High Credit Utilisation: -50+ points 
Using more than 30% of available credit 
Signals financial stress to lenders 
Court Judgments: -100+ points 
Public record of unpaid debts 
Extremely difficult to get loans
The bottom line: Worrying about a 3-point inquiry drop while ignoring a 100-point default is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

Frequently Asked Questions 
Q: How many hard inquiries are too many? 
A: More than 2-3 in 12 months starts to hurt, especially if you have existing credit issues. If you're getting rejected, stop applying and fix the underlying problems first. 
Q: Will removing defaults also remove the associated inquiries? 
A: No, defaults and inquiries are separate items. However, removing defaults has a much bigger positive impact than removing inquiries. 
Q: Can you remove hard inquiries from my credit file? 
A: Only if they're unauthorised or incorrect. Legitimate inquiries from applications you made can't be removed. But frankly, if you have defaults, that's where we focus our efforts. 
Q: How long after fixing my credit should I wait to apply? 
A: Typically 6-12 months after removing negative items. We help you time applications perfectly for maximum approval chances.
Q: Is it worth paying someone to remove inquiries? 
A: Usually not. If inquiries are your only problem, just wait - they'll drop off naturally. If you have bigger issues (defaults, late payments), focus on those first.
