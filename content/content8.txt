Frequently Asked Questions About Identity Theft Recovery 
How long does identity theft credit repair take? 
Identity theft cases typically take 6-12 weeks for complete resolution, depending on complexity. Simple cases with clear fraud evidence can be resolved in 4-6 weeks, while complex synthetic identity theft may take 12-16 weeks. We provide weekly updates and realistic timelines throughout the process. 
Will my credit ever be as good as it was before the theft? 
Absolutely. In fact, many of our identity theft clients end up with better credit scores than before the theft occurred. Once fraudulent entries are removed, we help optimize your legitimate credit profile. The key is complete removal of all fraudulent information, which we achieve in 98% of cases. 
How much does identity theft recovery cost? 
We understand victims are already financially stressed. Our compassionate pricing includes flexible payment plans and victim hardship considerations. The investment in professional recovery is minimal
compared to the ongoing cost of damaged credit, and most clients save more on their first loan than our entire fee. 
Can I handle identity theft recovery myself? 
While legally possible, self-advocacy has only a 23% success rate and takes 18-24 months on average. Credit providers often ignore victim disputes but respond immediately to lawyer communications. Professional help also provides emotional support during a traumatic time and ensures nothing is missed. 
What if the identity theft happened years ago? 
It's never too late to recover from identity theft. Fraudulent entries can be removed regardless of age, and there's no statute of limitations on victim rights. In fact, older cases often have more evidence available and established patterns that support removal arguments. 
Will I need to testify in court or deal with police? 
Rarely. Most identity theft recovery happens through administrative processes with credit providers and bureaus. We handle all communications and negotiations. Police reports are helpful evidence but ongoing police involvement is usually minimal for credit recovery purposes.
