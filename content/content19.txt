How Much Does Bad Credit Really Cost You? 
The Hidden Monthly Drain on Your Wallet 
Before you worry about our fees, consider what bad credit is already costing you: Home Loans: 
Good Credit: 3.5% interest = $1,750/month on $500K 
Bad Credit: 8.5% interest = $2,456/month on $500K 
Monthly Cost of Bad Credit: $706 MORE 
Car Finance: 
Good Credit: 5% interest = $443/month on $25K 
Bad Credit: 18% interest = $634/month on $25K 
Monthly Cost of Bad Credit: $191 MORE 
Personal Loans: 
Good Credit: 7% interest on $20K = $198/month 
Bad Credit: 24% interest on $20K = $264/month 
Monthly Cost of Bad Credit: $66 MORE 
Your bad credit is costing you $963+ EXTRA every month. Our service pays for itself in weeks, not years.

Frequently Asked Questions About Affordable Credit Repair 
How can you offer award-winning service so affordably? 
Our efficient business model, high volume, and technology investments allow us to deliver premium results at affordable prices. We don't waste money on expensive marketing or fancy offices – those savings go directly to keeping our fees low while maintaining the same award-winning quality. 
Are there any hidden costs or fees? 
Absolutely not. Our pricing is completely transparent: small admin fee upfront, then success fees only when items are removed. No setup fees, no monthly charges, no hidden costs. What we quote is what you pay – nothing more. 
Can I get a payment plan if I can't afford the upfront fee? 
Yes! We offer flexible payment plans including splitting the admin fee into manageable monthly payments. We also offer deferred success fee payments for genuine hardship cases. Everyone deserves a fresh start regardless of their current financial situation. 
Is your affordable service lower quality than expensive competitors? 
Not at all. We use the same qualified lawyers, same proven process, and achieve the same 98% success rate as expensive competitors. Our awards prove our quality hasn't decreased despite affordable pricing. You get premium results without premium prices. 
How do you compare to cheap credit repair services? 
Those ultra-cheap services are usually scams or unlicensed operators with near-zero success rates. We're ASIC licensed, award-winning, and have a 98% success rate. Our affordable pricing delivers real results while cheap services typically waste your money and time. 
What happens if you can't remove my defaults? 
With our No Win No Fee guarantee, you don't pay success fees if we can't remove items. You've only invested the small admin fee, which covers our assessment and initial work. Unlike other companies that keep all your money regardless of results, we only charge success fees for actual success.
