            <p>
              Theoretically, the higher the credit rating you have, the better
              it is to be. However, there&apos;s more to your credit rating than just
              a number-and this can be difficult for some people to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your credit rating is a number that measures how reliable you are
              when it comes repayment or not being late on repayments in
              comparison with other people who take out similar type of loans
              and financial products. This score will then determine what
              interest rate they charge you when borrowing money from them.
            </p>
            <p>
              To fix bad credit in Melbourne, you should first understand what&apos;s
              in your credit file. After all, if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s impacting
              your credit rating, there&apos;s no way for you to identify the
              problems and work toward a solution.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0668a5] mb-4">
              There are three important factors that make up a person&apos;s score:

              <li>payment history,</li>

            <p className="mt-4">
              These three things constitute up to 95% of your rating! If these
              areas are less than ideal where they should be good, it might take
              some time and patience to repair them.

              The next step in repairing bad credit:
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The next step in repairing bad credit is paying down your balance
              on current accounts that have become delinquent with payments over
              90 days late thus putting them into collections status - most
              notably this includes automobile loans, mortgage, bank lines of
              credits and store accounts that carry high balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have unpaid debts, then you may be interested in knowing
              that there are options that can help. One option is to pay off the
              debts through your earnings. This option often takes a long time
              and may not work for people who don&apos;t earn enough money. Another
              step is for you to file bankruptcy, which will discharge some or
              all of your debt but has serious consequences such as being unable
              to file for certain types of credit for 10 years afterward.
            </p>
          </div>

                </span>
                <p>
                  If you have late payments on your credit card, make sure that
                  they are all revolving balances so as to avoid having the card
                  canceled if you can&apos;t keep up with it.

                </span>
                <p>
                  Try not to use your credit cards too often or charge much more
                  than what you can afford in order to limit unpaid debt.

                  Pay cash for everything if possible because this will help
                  minimize debt and prevent paying an unnecessary interest rate
                  or carrying a balance that may be higher than necessary
                  because of high introductory rates or promotional offers.
