          What is RHI and Why It's Damaging Your Credit
        </h2>
        <div className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
          <p>
            RHI stands for Repayment History Information, and it's one of the most critical factors affecting your credit score. Unlike traditional credit information that shows your current account status, RHI provides a detailed 24-month history of how you've managed your credit accounts, including payment patterns, account status changes, and financial behavior.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The problem is that RHI can contain outdated, incorrect, or misleading information that doesn't reflect your current financial situation. Maybe you had a difficult period a year ago, but you've since recovered and are managing your finances responsibly. However, that old RHI is still dragging down your credit score and affecting your ability to get approved for loans, credit cards, and even rental applications.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Australian Credit Solutions specialises in RHI removal across Australia. We're award-winning specialists with a 98% success rate when we take cases. We identify incorrect, outdated, or improperly reported RHI and work with credit bureaus to have it removed from your credit file.
