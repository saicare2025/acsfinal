    {
      question: "What credit score do I need to buy a house in Australia?",
      answer:
        "Most Australian lenders want to see a credit score of at least 600 for home loan approval, but 700+ gives you access to the best rates. With a score below 600, you&apos;ll likely need specialist lenders and may face higher interest rates and deposit requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I check my credit score?",
      answer:
        "Check your credit score monthly if possible, but at minimum every 3 months. You&apos;re entitled to one free credit report annually from each bureau, but many online services offer free monthly score updates. Regular monitoring helps you catch errors or fraud early.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can paying bills late really affect my credit score?",
      answer:
        "Yes, absolutely. Bills over $150 that are 60+ days overdue can be listed as defaults, which severely damage your score for 5 years. Even smaller late payments on credit cards and loans are recorded and negatively impact your score.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do defaults stay on my credit file in Australia?",
      answer:
        "Defaults remain on your Australian credit file for 5 years from the date they were listed, not from when the debt was paid. However, professional credit repair can sometimes get defaults removed earlier if there were errors in the listing process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does income affect my credit score in Australia?",
      answer:
        "No, your income doesn&apos;t directly affect your credit score calculation. However, lenders do consider your income when deciding whether to approve loans, as they need to assess your ability to repay the debt.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I improve my credit score quickly?",
      answer:
        "Some improvements can happen quickly (1-3 months) like fixing errors or paying down high credit card balances. However, building a strong credit score generally takes 12-24 months of consistent positive behavior. Be wary of any service promising overnight score improvements.",
    },
    {
      question: "What&apos;s the difference between credit scores from different bureaus?",
      answer:
        "Different credit bureaus use slightly different scoring models and may have different information about you. Your score can vary by 50-100 points between bureaus. Lenders typically use one primary bureau, so it&apos;s worth knowing which one your preferred lenders check.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should I close credit cards I don&apos;t use?",
      answer:
        "Generally no, unless the card has an annual fee you want to avoid. Closing cards reduces your available credit and can hurt your utilization ratio. It also shortens your average account age. Keep old cards open with small occasional purchases to maintain them.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can my credit score go down for no reason?",
      answer:
        "Credit scores fluctuate naturally due to reporting timing, utilization changes, and account aging. A drop of 10-20 points without any major changes is normal. However, significant drops usually indicate new negative information or increased credit utilization.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my credit score if I move overseas?",
      answer:
        "Your Australian credit history doesn&apos;t transfer to other countries, and their credit history doesn&apos;t transfer here. When you return to Australia, your old credit file will still exist, but the scoring models may weight recent activity more heavily than older information.",
